SIP (Systematic Investment Plans) allow investors to invest fixed amounts regularly into mutual funds.
They help in rupee-cost averaging and instill financial discipline.
Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS) are SIPs that offer tax savings under Section 80C.
Long-term investments through SIPs benefit from compound growth and lower market volatility.
